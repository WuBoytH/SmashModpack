Thank you for checking out my modpack!

Installation:
Simply drag all of the files (except for README.md and Final Kill Screen Preview.png) into the root of your SD card, and you should be ready to go!
You also need to install ARCropolis, which you can find here: https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis

If you have installed a previous version of the modpack:
In this update, I have moved the files from:
SD:\atmosphere\contents\01006A800016E000\romfs\arc
to: SD:\ultimate\mods\Skin Fixes
Please delete the first folder from your SD card, as you will not need it anymore.

You can choose not to use this, but many skins will look wrong due to how Smash Ultimate loads files.
Hopefully, in the future, this kind of fix will be unneccessary and can be removed from the modpack, my apologies for the inconvenience!

The Scarlet Smash Modpack Optionals includes:
 - text edits throughout menus, Star Fox's final smash subtitles, and Hero's spell list, for the fun of it =)
 - "THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING" from BlazBlue Centralfiction, when the announcer says "READY" in a battle arena
 - a yellow and green kill-screen background when you deal a finishing blow, you can preview it with "Final Kill Screen Preview.png"

If you do not wish to use any of these, feel free to delete "The Scarlet Smash Modpack Optionals" from SD:\ultimate\mods\.
If you wish to keep only some of these, the files are as follows:

 - Text edits: SD:\ultimate\mods\The Scarlet Smash Ultimate Modpack Optionals\ui\message\msg_melee.msbt and msg_menu.msbt
 - "THE WHEEL OF FATE IS TURNING": SD:\ultimate\mods\The Scarlet Smash Ultimate Modpack Optionals\sound\bank\narration\vc_narration_menu.nus3audio
 - the final kill screen: SD:\ultimate\mods\The Scarlet Smash Ultimate Modpack Optionals\effect\system\common\ef_common.eff

ISSUES/BUGS:

 - Steve's custom Final Smash video has a gap in the audio, due to how his sound effects work.
 - Certain skins may still have issues with their textures, as I have not added their skin fixes yet.
 - I don't have announcer calls ready for every character yet, so some characters may have mis-matched announcer calls. This will be fixed in due time.
